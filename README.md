# Discord Promotion Bot
This is my Discord Soldier Management bot made using Javascipt.

## About Me
### Why am I making this?
I enjoyed making a few test bots and being in a milsim-y group decided to try and make this for them.

### When do I work on this?
I have worked on this project over the spam of 2 weeks to get the basics done. After implementing it in a different server I updated a lot of it to follow their structure and added more features on their request.

## What does it do exactly?
### Ranks
The main purpose of this bot was to allow higher ranked personal to promote other personnel easely without having to worry about name and role changes.

### Nicknames
The second part of the bots goal is to manage users names so their rank and nickname is displayed and automatically updated when needed.

### Awards
I added a command for awarding service awards with ease. This has been disabled for the current group.

### Careers
I added a command for assigning careers with ease.

### Units
I added a command for assigning units with ease.

### Enlist
I added a way to easely enlist people, managing their administrative roles and giving them a preset rank, career and unit.

### Discharge
I added a way to easely discharge people, managing administrative roles and removing their rank, career and unit.

### Stats
I also included a way to see a list of all the people filtered in their units and careers.

### Joining
It also automatically adds roles and changes the name of people that join.

## How is it made?
### Language
It is almost all written in Javascipt using the [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) library.

### Data storage
I used json files with formatted text which are loaded at startup.
