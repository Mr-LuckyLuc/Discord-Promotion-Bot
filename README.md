# Discord-RP-Bot
This is my Discord Promotion bot made using Javascipt.

## About Me
### Why am I making this?
I enjoyed making a few test bots and being in the group so decided to try and make this for them.

### When do I work on this?
I have worked on this project over the spam of 2 weeks. Now it is mostly done though.

## What does it do exactly?
# Promotions
The main purpose of this bot was to allow officers to promote elisted personnel easely without having to worry about name and role changes.

# Awards
I also added a system for awarding service awards with ease.

# Joining
It also automatically adds roles and changes the name of people that join.

## How is it made?
### Language
It is almost all written in Javascipt using the [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) library.

### Data storage
I used normal text files with json formatted text which are loaded at startup.
