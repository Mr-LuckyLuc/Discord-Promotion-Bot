# Discord-RP-Bot
This is my Discord Roleplay bot made using Javascipt.

## About Me
### Why am I making this?
I enjoyed making a few test bots and now I wanted to make my first proper Discord bot.

### When do I work on this?
I have worked on this project over the spam of multiple months so far. I usually work on it during my free time outside of school.

## What is it exactly?
### Environment
The environment consists of multiple places you can visit. Each will have different people and have unique things you can do.

### The people
The people you meet are fellow adventurers who are also following their own path trough the world. There are will be no AI people, everyone will be a real person!

### Activities
As a traveler you will be able to harvest resources to trade with other people or buy items from shops.

### Economy?
Yes, there is an economy. You are able to buy items, trade items or harvest/craft items yourself to use for trading.

### Can I play it now?
It is still in development so you can not play it yet. When it is big enough to invite people there will a link here to participate in the adventure.

## How is it made?
### Language
It is almost all written in Javascipt using the [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) library.

### Data storage
It uses [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) using the [mysql2](https://sidorares.github.io/node-mysql2/docs) library to store its data in a database which is saved on the same server.

### Can I follow the development?
Kind of, I will do my best to do commits often enough (meaning: not commiting a months of active work in 1 go but commiting every few hours of work that has been done) and maybe making dev logs and issues.

## Can I help?
For now I am developing this on my own but if it gets big I might ask some people to help. Don't count on it.
